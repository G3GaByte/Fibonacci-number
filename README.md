Each button is labelled with its respective function and is clicked using the leftMouseButton.

for Android, please change the perspective to landscape, as it only supports landscape.

-----------------------=[Design choices]=---------------------

The colours that I have chosen to use are pastel colours. In a graphics design persepective, pastel colours represent neutrality, peacefulness & softness.
Seeing how this app is showing a simple sequence that the player gets to be in control over, I believe being subtle in the aspects of the app would be best. In a similar sense I chose background music to fit the peacefulness theme as well as the button click sound effect. These feautures would help players relax and unwind which would be my goal when making an app like this. The shapes are simple as to not overcomplicate the app. I also decided to have a visual of 3D instead of 2D as there would be more flexibility to the addition and subtraction of assets and game mechanics into the app when further developing than a 2D platform.
